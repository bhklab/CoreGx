Description: A collection of functions and classes which serve as the foundation 
    for the Gx suite of R packages, such as PharmacoGx and RadioGx. This package 
    was created to abstract shared functionality from other BHK Lab releases to 
    increase ease of maintainability and reduce code repetition in current and 
    future Gx suite programs. Major features include a CoreSet class, from which 
    RadioSet and PharmacoSet are derived, along with getter and setter methods 
    for each respective slot. Additional functions related to fitting and 
    plotting dose response curves, quantifying statistical correlation and 
    calculating AUC or SF are included. For more details please see the included 
    documentation, as well as: Smirnov, P. et al. (2015) 
    <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv723>, Vankata, M. et al.
