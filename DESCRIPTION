Description: A collection of functions and classes which serve as the foundation 
    for the our labs suite of R packages, such as Pharmacogenomics and 
    Radiogenomics. This package was created to abstract shared functionality 
    from other lab package releases to increase ease of maintainability and 
    reduce code repetition in current and future suite programs. Major features 
    include a "core set" class, from which "radio set" and "pharmacology set" 
    are derived, along with get and set methods for each respective slot. 
    Additional functions related to fitting and plotting dose response curves, 
    quantifying statistical correlation and calculating AUC or SF are included. 
    For more details please see the included documentation, as well as: Smirnov,
    P. and others (2015) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv723>, V.M. and others 
    (2019) <doi:10.1101/449793>.
