}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[`LongTable`] object to retrieve assays from}

\item{i}{[`character`] name or [`integer`] index of the desired assay.}

\item{keys}{[`logical`] Should the row and column keys also be returned?
Defaults to FALSE to make applying aggregate functions more convenient.}

\item{withDimnames}{[`logical`] Should the row and column IDs be joined to
the assay. Default is TRUE to allow easy use of group by arguments when
performing data aggregation using the `data.table` API.}

\item{metadata}{[`logical`] Should the row and column metadata also
be joined to the to the returned assay. Default is FALSE, but could be
useful if the metadata will be used for group by operation.}
}
\value{
[`LongTable`] object containing the assay data from a treatment
  response experiment
}
\description{
Define a private constructor method to be used to build a
  `LongTable` object.

Select an assay from within a LongTable object.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{rowData}}{A [`data.table`] containing the metadata associated with the
row dimension of a `LongTable`.}

\item{\code{colData}}{A [`data.table`] containing the metadata associated with the
column dimension of a `LongTable`.}

\item{\code{assays}}{A [`list`] of [`data.table`s], one for each assay in a
`LongTable`.}

\item{\code{metadata}}{An optional [`list`] of additional metadata for a `LongTable`
which doesn't map to one of the dimensions.}

\item{\code{.intern}}{An [`enivornment`] that holds internal structural metadata
about a LongTable object, such as which columns are required to key
the object. An environment has been used to allow locking items, which
can prevent accidental modification of a property required for the class
to work.}
