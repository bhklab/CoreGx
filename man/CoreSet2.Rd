\title{New implementation of the CoreSet constructor to support MAE and TRE. This
constructor will be swapped with the original \code{CoreSet} constructor as
part of an overhaul of the CoreSet class structure.}

\preformatted{@param name A `character(1)` vector with the `\{class_\}` objects name.
@param treatment A `data.frame` with treatment level metadata. \{tx_\}
@param sample A `data.frame` with sample level metadata for the union

@param molecularProfiles A `MultiAssayExperiment` containing one 
    `SummarizedExperiment` object for each molecular data type.
@param treatmentResponse A `LongTable` or `LongTableDataMapper` object
    containing all treatment response data associated with the `\{class_\}`
    object.
@param curation A `list(2)` object with two items named `treatment` and
    `sample` with mappings from publication identifiers to standardized
    identifiers for both annotations, respectively.
@param datasetType A `character(1)` One of
