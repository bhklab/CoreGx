\usage{
\S4method{buildLongTable}{character}(from, rowDataCols, colDataCols, assayCols)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{[`character`] Path to the .csv file containing the data and
metadata from which to build the `LongTable`.}

\item{rowDataCols}{[`list`] List with two `character` vectors, the first

\item{assayCols}{[`list`] A named list of character vectors specifying how to
parse assay columns into a list of `data.table`s. Each list data.table
will be named for the name of corresponding list item and contain the columns
specified in the character vector of column names in each list item.}
