LongTable(
  rowData,
  rowIDs,
  colData,
  colIDs,
  assays,
  metadata = list(),
  keep.rownames = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rowData}{[`data.table`, `data.frame`, `matrix`] A table like object
coercible to a `data.table` containing the a unique `rowID` column which
is used to key assays, as well as additional row metadata to subset on.}

\item{rowIDs}{[`character`, `integer`] A vector specifying
the names or integer indexes of the row data identifier columns. These
columns will be pasted together to make up the row.names of the
`LongTable` object.}

\item{colData}{[`data.table`, `data.frame`, `matrix`] A table like object
coercible to a `data.table` containing the a unique `colID` column which
is used to key assays, as well as additional column metadata to subset on.}

\item{colIDs}{[`character`, `integer`] A vector specifying
the names or integer indexes of the col data identifier columns. These
columns will be pasted together to make up the col.names of the
`LongTable` object.}

\item{assays}{A [`list`] containing one or more objects coercible to a
`data.table`, and keyed by rowID and colID corresponding to the rowID and
colID columns in colData and rowData.}

\item{metadata}{A [`list`] of metadata associated with the `LongTable`
object being constructed}

\item{keep.rownames}{[`logical` or `character`] Logical: whether rownames
should be added as a column if coercing to a `data.table`, default is FALSE.
If TRUE, rownames are added to the column 'rn'. Character: specify a custom
column name to store the rownames in.}
}
\value{
A [`LongTable`] object containing the data for a treatment response
  experiment and configured according to the rowIDs and colIDs arguments.
}
\description{
Builds a `LongTable` object from rectangular objects. The
`rowData` argument should contain row level metadata, while the `colData`
argument should contain column level metadata, for the experimental assays
in the `assays` list. The `rowIDs` and `colIDs` lists are used to configure
the internal keys mapping rows or columns to rows in the assays. Each list
should contain at minimum one character vector, specifying which columns
in `rowData` or `colData` are required to uniquely identify each row. An
optional second character vector can be included, specifying any metadata
columns for either dimension. These should contain information about each
row but NOT be required to uniquely identify a row in the `colData` or
`rowData` objects. Additional metadata can be attached to a `LongTable` by
passing a list to the metadata argument.
