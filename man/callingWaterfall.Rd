\item{intermediate.fold}{vector of fold changes used to define the intermediate sensitivities for ic50, actarea and amax respectively}

\item{cor.min.linear}{\code{numeric} The minimum linear correlation to 
require?}

\item{name}{\code{character} The name of the output to use in plot}

\item{plot}{\code{boolean} Whether to plot the results}

\value{
\code{factor} Containing the drug sensitivity status of each
  cellline.

\description{
1. Sensitivity calls were made using one of IC50, ActArea or Amax
}
\details{
2. Sort log IC50s (or ActArea or Amax) of the cell lines to generate a 
  “waterfall distribution”
  
3. Identify cutoff:

 3.1 If the waterfall distribution is non-linear (pearson cc to the linear 
   fit <=0.95), estimate the major inflection point of the log IC50 curve as 
   the point on the curve with the maximal distance to a line drawn between 
   the start and end points of the distribution.
   
 3.2 If the waterfall distribution appears linear (pearson cc to the linear 
   fit > 0.95), then use the median IC50 instead.
   
4. Cell lines within a 4-fold IC50 (or within a 1.2-fold ActArea or 20% Amax 
  difference) difference centered around this inflection point are classified 
  as being “intermediate”,  cell lines with lower IC50s (or ActArea/Amax 
  values) than this range are defined as sensitive, and those with IC50s (or 
  ActArea/Amax) higher than this range are called “insensitive”.
  
5. Require at least x sensitive and x insensitive cell lines after applying 
  these criteria (x=5 in our case).
